_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Here are some text editors that you can use. I will why they are useful later.

1. Notepad
2. Atom
3. Sublime Text
4. Notepad++

Ok, so the reasons why I chose these text editors:

1. Notepad:
I this might just sound straight out weird, but i'm not kidding! 
The notepad app are GREAT for begginers and does not have many features that might be confusing or too complicated for you.

2. Atom 
Atom is a great text editor if you are a <i>intermediate</i> coder.
